# madlib
This is the template code for the Madlib Challenge in Python Course #1

For the madlib challenge, create a madlib where a user can enter 5 words (strings) of their choice and it would be reflected in the output. 
The words should be: 1 noun, 2 adjectives, and 2 verbs. 

Reviewers should be able to tell which words are which based on the variable names. \

There should only be ONE print statement that reflects the inclusion of all the user's string inputs.
